Variables : It is the name of a memory location. It is also known as identifiers.

So rules for declaring a variable is same as an identifiers.

1) The variable name can contain 
   alphabets (a-z/A-Z)
   digits (0-9)
   underscore (_)

2) A variable name can start with an alphabet or underscore. But it cant start with a digit.

3) A variable can not contain any symbol or special characters like (./\*&^%$#@).


1) Find valid variables.
cash# = 12  -----Invlaid
__abc__ABC = 'Starting' -----valid

2) type() : This method is a predefined method which gives the datatype of the variable.
In python everything is an object. So datatypes are consider as a class.

a = 5
print(type(a)) #<class int>

3) id() : This method is also a predefined method which gives the memory address of the variable stored.

a = 5
print(id(a)) #7687983709
